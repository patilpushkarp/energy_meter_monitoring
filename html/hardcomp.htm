<p style="padding-left:50px;padding-top:50px;padding-right:50px;">
Arduino (sold as Genuino outside of the U.S. and U.K due to a trademark dispute) is a hardware and software company, project, and user community that designs and manufactures computer hardware, open-source software, and microcontroller-based kits for building digital devices and interactive objects that can sense and control physical devices.</p>

<p style="padding-left:50px;padding-right:50px;">The project is based on microcontroller board designs, produced by several vendors, using various microcontrollers. These systems provide sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that can interface to various expansion boards (termed shields) and other circuits. The boards feature serial communication interfaces, including Universal Serial Bus (USB) on some models, for loading programs from personal computers. For programming the microcontrollers, the Arduino project provides an integrated development environment (IDE) based on a programming language named Processing, which also supports the languages C and C++.</p>

<p style="padding-left:50px;padding-right:50px;">The first Arduino was introduced in 2005, aiming to provide a low cost, easy way for novices and professionals to create devices that interact with their environment using sensors and actuators. Common examples of such devices intended for beginner hobbyists include simple robots, thermostats, and motion detectors.</p>

<p style="padding-left:50px;padding-bottom:50px;padding-right:50px;">Arduino boards are available commercially in preassembled form, or as do-it-yourself kits. The hardware design specifications and Bill of materials have been made openly available by the community but have never been released by the Arduino staff. The effort of the community to retrieve this information despite the lack of answers by the Arduino staff, together with the benevolence of the Arduino staff towards clones and replicas, have allowed the Arduino boards to be produced by anyone. Adafruit Industries estimated in mid-2011 that over 300,000 official Arduinos had been commercially produced, and in 2013 that 700,000 official boards were in users' hands.</p>

    <h2 class="text-center" style="color:#000099">Wifi Module</h2>
    <h3 class="text-center" style="color:#cc0000">ESP 8266 01</h3>
<p style="padding-left:50px;padding-top:50px;padding-right:50px;">
The ESP8266 is a low-cost Wi-Fi chip with full TCP/IP stack and microcontroller capability produced by Shanghai-based Chinese manufacturer, Espressif Systems.

The chip first came to the attention of western makers in August 2014 with the ESP-01 module, made by a third-party manufacturer, AI-Thinker. This small module allows microcontrollers to connect to a Wi-Fi network and make simple TCP/IP connections using Hayes-style commands. However, at the time there was almost no English-language documentation on the chip and the commands it accepted. The very low price and the fact that there were very few external components on the module which suggests that it could eventually be very inexpensive in volume, attracted many hackers to explore the module, chip, and the software on it, as well as to translate the Chinese documentation.
</p>

<p style="padding-left:50px;padding-right:50px;">
The ESP8266-01 is the smallest ESP8266 module and only has 8 pins. Of these VCC, GND, RST (reset) and CH_PD (chip select) are not I/O pins but are needed the operation of the module. This leaves GPIO0, GPIO2, TX and RX available as possible I/O pins, but even these have pre-assigned functions. The GPIO0 and GPIO2 determine what mode the module starts up in and the TX/RX pins are used to program the module and for Serial I/O, commonly used for debugging. GPIO0 and GPIO2 need to have pull-up resistors connected to ensure the module starts up correctly.
</p>

<p style="padding-left:50px;padding-right:50px;">
A few things to note:
</p>
<p style="padding-left:50px;padding-right:50px;">
   1. GPIO1 (TX) is used as the Data line, because you will always get some debug output on GPIO1 on power up. There is no way to suppress this output, but the Clock line (RX) will be held high so none of this data will be clocked to the slaves
</p>
<p style="padding-left:50px;padding-right:50px;">
   2. When programming the ESP8266, the RX line is connected to the programmer's output. At the end of the programming the ESP8266 reboots and 330 Protection resistor prevents RX shorting the programmer's output drive.
</p>
<p style="padding-left:50px;padding-bottom:50px;padding-right:50px;">
   3. The I2C series resistors provide similar protection for the TX, RX from shorts on the I2C bus

    <h2 class="text-center" style="color:#000099">Voltage Regulator</h2>
    <h3 class="text-center" style="color:#cc0000">LD33V3</h3>
<p style="padding-left:50px;padding-top:50px;padding-right:50px;">
The 78xx (sometimes L78xx, LM78xx, MC78xx...) is a family of self-contained fixed linear voltage regulator integrated circuits. The 78xx family is commonly used in electronic circuits requiring a regulated power supply due to their ease-of-use and low cost. For ICs within the family, the xx is replaced with two digits, indicating the output voltage (for example, the 7805 has a 5-volt output, while the 7812 produces 12 volts). The 78xx line are positive voltage regulators: they produce a voltage that is positive relative to a common ground. There is a related line of 79xx devices which are complementary negative voltage regulators. 78xx and 79xx ICs can be used in combination to provide positive and negative supply voltages in the same circuit.
</p>

<p style="padding-left:50px;padding-right:50px;">
78xx series ICs do not require additional components to provide a constant, regulated source of power, making them easy to use, as well as economical and efficient uses of space. Other voltage regulators may require additional components to set the output voltage level, or to assist in the regulation process. Some other designs (such as a switched-mode power supply) may need substantial engineering expertise to implement.
    78xx series ICs have built-in protection against a circuit drawing too much current. They have protection against overheating and short-circuits, making them quite robust in most applications. In some cases, the current-limiting features of the 78xx devices can provide protection not only for the 78xx itself, but also for other parts of the circuit.
</p>

<p style="padding-left:50px;padding-bottom:50px;padding-right:50px;">
The input voltage must always be higher than the output voltage by some minimum amount (typically 2.5 volts). This can make these devices unsuitable for powering some devices from certain types of power sources (for example, powering a circuit that requires 5 volts using 6-volt batteries will not work using a 7805).
    As they are based on a linear regulator design, the input current required is always the same as the output current. As the input voltage must always be higher than the output voltage, this means that the total power (voltage multiplied by current) going into the 78xx will be more than the output power provided. The difference is dissipated as heat. This means both that for some applications an adequate heatsink must be provided, and also that a (often substantial) portion of the input power is wasted during the process, rendering them less efficient than some other types of power supplies. When the input voltage is significantly higher than the regulated output voltage (for example, powering a 7805 using a 24 volt power source), this inefficiency can be a significant issue. Buck converters may be preferred over 78xx regulators because they are more efficient and do not require heat sinks, but they are more expensive.

    <h2 class="text-center" style="color:#000099">Photoresistor</h2>
    <h3 class="text-center" style="color:#cc0000">LM393 Based LDR</h3>
<p style="padding-left:50px;padding-top:50px;padding-right:50px;">
A photoresistor (or light-dependent resistor, LDR, or photocell) is a light-controlled variable resistor. The resistance of a photoresistor decreases with increasing incident light intensity; in other words, it exhibits photoconductivity. A photoresistor can be applied in light-sensitive detector circuits, and light- and dark-activated switching circuits.
</p>

<p style="padding-left:50px;padding-right:50px;">
A photoresistor is made of a high resistance semiconductor. In the dark, a photoresistor can have a resistance as high as several megohms (MΩ), while in the light, a photoresistor can have a resistance as low as a few hundred ohms. If incident light on a photoresistor exceeds a certain frequency, photons absorbed by the semiconductor give bound electrons enough energy to jump into the conduction band. The resulting free electrons (and their hole partners) conduct electricity, thereby lowering resistance. The resistance range and sensitivity of a photoresistor can substantially differ among dissimilar devices. Moreover, unique photoresistors may react substantially differently to photons within certain wavelength bands.
</p>

<p style="padding-left:50px;padding-bottom:50px;padding-right:50px;">
A photoelectric device can be either intrinsic or extrinsic. An intrinsic semiconductor has its own charge carriers and is not an efficient semiconductor, for example, silicon. In intrinsic devices the only available electrons are in the valence band, and hence the photon must have enough energy to excite the electron across the entire bandgap. Extrinsic devices have impurities, also called dopants, added whose ground state energy is closer to the conduction band; since the electrons do not have as far to jump, lower energy photons (that is, longer wavelengths and lower frequencies) are sufficient to trigger the device. If a sample of silicon has some of its atoms replaced by phosphorus atoms (impurities), there will be extra electrons available for conduction. This is an example of an extrinsic semiconductor.
